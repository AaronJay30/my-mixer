###Description: A social network website purely based on Flask. A twitter liked website where you and your friends can create an account for the website and you can post your thoughts without restriction. You can also like the post of others or comment to their post.
###

**Note**: I started learning Flask on CS50 course and I decided for my Final Project to build a Twitter Clone which you can post, comment and react. At first my ideas is to create a website that will help you decide what movie you will watched. But after a day I reject that idea and start working with a social network, 
		  because I think I can do better than my old idea and challenge myself. It took me 3 days to finish this project but it's worth it because it taught me a lot of information i dont know before
