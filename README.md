# Mixer

A social network website purely based on Flask

<b>Note</b>: I started learning Flask on CS50 course and I decided for my Final Project to build a Twitter Clone which you can post, comment and react


<b>Languages & Database Used</b>:
  1. Python
  2. Flask
  3. Html - CSS 
  4. Sqlite

<b>Features</b>:
  1. User-Login and Registration 
  2. Friends (Following and Unfollowing)
  3. User Search
  4. Edit or Delete a post
  5. Changing password and name
  6. Commenting and liking post
  7. Checking your followers and following
  8. And some small features that you'll see for sure while using
  
<b>Future Plans</b>:
  1. Making the UI more comfy,stable and also suitable for mobile devices(currently only desktop users can properly access it)
  2. Email Verification(Function is present in the code just gotta impliment it properly)
  3. User Chats
  4. Some API implimentation to get user data in json format for debugging or testing
  5. Implimenting Ajax(so my pages wont load again and again on specific actions like <b>likes and comments</b>
